# odin-recipes
## Brief description
This project is part of the introduction section of The Odin Project.
Through this project I'm going to demonstrate the basics of HTML that I learned.
The task is to create 3 webpages each containing one recipe with HTML only.

## Summary
During this project I got a bit used to shortcuts in visual studio code in order to make the whole proces of copying text information easier and quicker. So far I'm happy with the result. I tried to keep the code readable and formatted. The biggest problem were git commit messages. So fat I dont't know what to really type into them in order to make them useful for someone else.
